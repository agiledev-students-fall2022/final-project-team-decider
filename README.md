ðŸ“š [In Library]<br>
ðŸ«  : Hey, what are you working on? <br>
ðŸ¥¸ : OS lab. You?<br>
ðŸ«  : Oh me too. Hey I've been sitting here the whole morning. Do you wanna grab a coffee? <br>
ðŸ¥¸ : Ofc. Wanna try <em><strong>sth different</strong></em>? <br>
ðŸ«  : Definitely!! But which one... <br>

### <li> <strong>How does Decider help and create a fun experience?</strong></li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Quickly generate a link/group link that can be shared across any group chat such as text, messenger, etc. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Users can enter optional information to refine the hangout, including timeframe, location, and purposes. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Users will have a customized list of recommendations and also be able to add potential places mannually.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group members can check the selected place list at any time, vote on places, and see the final decision.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The web app is conveniently connected to Map applications (Google Maps, etc).</strong></li>
</ol><br>

Clone the [Decider Repo](https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2022/final-project-team-decider.git) by ```git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2022/final-project-team-decider.git```

1. Make sure you have Node installed.<br>
Both the back-end and front-end should be running.<br>

2. Go to the back-end folder by ```cd back-end```<br>
Install necessary packages by ```npm install```<br>
Run ```nodemon server```<br>
You can open ```http://localhost:4000``` to see back end.<br>

3. Go to the front-end folder by ```cd front-end```<br>
Install necessary packages by ```npm install```<br>
Run ```npm start```<br>
You can open ```http://localhost:3000``` to see front end.<br>
This shell used for front end should be a different shell from the shell used for back end.<br>

4. Unit tests: ```cd back-end```<br>
```npm test```<br>

5. Docker container<br>
Make sure you have Docker installed.<br>
Launch docker daemon, you can do this through running the Docker Desktop application.<br>
Open a shell and run<br>
```docker pull yvonne511/final-project-decider-back-end```<br>
```docker pull yvonne511/final-project-decider-front-end```<br>
```docker run -ti --rm yvonne511/final-project-decider-back-end```<br>
Open another shell and run<br>
```docker run -ti --rm yvonne511/final-project-decider-front-end```<br>
The above two ```docker run``` commands may take some time.<br>
You can open ```http://localhost:3000``` to see front end and open ```http://localhost:4000``` to see back end.<br>

6. Continuous deployment<br>
Github Build & Deploy action automate deploy process.<br>
Any change to master brance will trigger deploy.yml action.<br>
It removes the previous build deployed with docker compose, and rebuild another one.<br>
The second badge at the top of this file demonstrate continuous deployment is working.<br>

Use ```process.env.REACT_APP_BACK_END_URL/groups``` or ```http://localhost:4000/groups``` to see available groups, then join a trial group to have a multi-user experience.
After sign up an account, use the account to log in to use more features in ```view``` page, or you can use an existing testing account with username ```abc``` and password ```123```.
After join a group from clicking ```enter``` with input group id, the group is added to the current user's group list if the group is not already in the user's group list, and the user is switched to the group.

Then the user can view the newly added group in ```view``` page, other database query options can be performed in ```view``` page
such as ```remove a group from group list```, ```remove all group from group list```, these queries are only performed
in the ```my_groups``` array of the current user, not influencing the groups themselves. The user can also see the current username and current group in view page. More information about ```myLocations, myCurLocation``` can also be seen from opening developer tools in the broswer and then choose ```Applications -> local Storage -> http://localhost:3000```. 

To switch a group, copy a group number from ```group list``` in ```view (group information)``` page, then go back to ```http://localhost:3000``` and use the copied group number as input to the ```Enter Group ID``` in the text box and hit enter. You can see the changed group by checking the current group in ```view (group information)``` page.

After create a group in ```Home``` page, automatically redirect to  ```Recommend``` page and join that group.
Can also ```remove a group from database``` here, these queries are performed to create or remove the groups themselves.

### Note

* The ```Recommend``` page may take 1-2 sec to show up when you first go into it.
* Log-in/Sign-up pages are for future usage and development.
* This web app is in mobile-first design. It's preferable to be tested in mobile sizes.
* If the ```Recommend``` page doesn't show, try ```inspect``` and enter ```localStorage.setItem('myCurLocation','196')``` in the console, then 
* There may be some time delay when rendering ```view``` (group information) page for logged in users.
* ```nodemon``` is alreadyp included in ```back-end/package-lock.json```. However, if after ```npm install```, ```nodemon``` command still cannot be found, use ```npm install -g nodemon``` to install ```nodemon```.
